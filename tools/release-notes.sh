# goreleaser publishes a grouped commit log plus the install footer. The
# config has always said the curated summary "still gets written by hand on
# the release page" (.goreleaser.yaml, changelog:), and by hand is exactly why
# it went missing: v0.20.0 and v0.21.0 got one, v0.22.0 did not, and the page
# a reader lands on from the Store or a tweet was 290 commit subjects while
# gadak.dev/changelog/ said something a person would read. Nothing tied the
# two. This is the tie: the summary is the CHANGELOG.md section for the tag,
# its GDK references are defined under it (a bare [GDK-n] renders as literal
# brackets on GitHub), and the generated log stays underneath as the tail.
#
# Rerunnable. Whatever sits above the first "## Changelog" is treated as the
# previous summary and replaced, so editing CHANGELOG.md after a release and
# running this again is the whole update path — which is the case that made
# this script: the 0.22.0 section was cut from 4,983 words to 1,500 the day
# after the tag, and the release page kept the old shape.
#
# It also drops the update-check sentence the footer carried through v0.22.0.
# There is no update check (GDK-1626); the claim sat in every release body
# from v0.19 on, and editing a page without removing it would re-publish it.
